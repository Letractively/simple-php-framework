	<h1>Simple PHP Framework Overview</h1>
	<p>Seeing as how the Simple PHP Framework is . . . a <em>framework</em> . . . there's really not much to install. However, there are a few options you need to set and a database table you can (optionally) install. <strong>I know this looks like a lot of text to read, but trust me. It'll take less than five minutes to read and complete the instructions below. You'll have a working site and a clear understanding of how everything is setup. It's worth it!</strong> Let's start with setting up your config options.</p>

	<h2>master.inc.php</h2>
	<p>The file <code>/includes/master.inc.php</code> is where most of the Framework's configuration options are set. It's also the starting point for your website. i.e. most of the pages you build will include it before doing any other work.</p>

	<h3>Server Names</h3>
	<p>The first thing you need to set are your server names. These three arrays (<code>$local_servers</code>, <code>$staging_servers</code>, and <code>$production_servers</code>) allow you to have different settings (a different database connection for example) based on where you code is running. This is useful for when you build and test your site locally and then upload it to a staging or production server. So, open up <code>/includes/master.inc.php</code> and edit them to reflect the server names you are using.</p>
	<p>For example, if you are testing your code locally at <code>http://yoursite.dev</code> and then uploading it to <code>http://www.yourwebsite.com</code> your server arrays should look like this:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000BB">$local_servers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;array(</span><span style="color: #DD0000">"yoursite.dev"</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$staging_servers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;array();<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$production_servers&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;array(</span><span style="color: #DD0000">"www.yourwebsite.com", "yourwebsite.com"</span><span style="color: #007700">);</span></span></pre>
	<p>Note that you can leave any of the arrays empty or fill them up with as many server names as you want. It just depends on how your site is setup.</p>

	<h3>Database Settings</h3>
	<p>Directly below the server name arrays is a large <code>if</code> statement that tests to see which server you're currently running on and then picks the appropriate settings. Setup your database name, hostname, and login info here.</p>
	<p>You can also customize your error reporting settings here. Note that the local server has error reporting turned on, while the production server has it turned off (for security purposes). Feel free to add your own configuration options into this code block.</p>

	<h3>Include Files</h3>
	<p>A little further down you'll see two include files: <code>/includes/functions.inc.php</code> and <code>/includes/class.objects.php</code>. These are important - that's why they're included in <code>master.inc.php</code>. The first file contains many useful utility functions as well as <a href='http://us2.php.net/__autoload'><code>__autoload()</code></a>, which loads in all the other include files as needed. The second file loads all of your <code>DBObject</code> subclasses.</p>
	<p>Use this space to include any other files that are needed globally.</p>

	<h3>User Authentication</h3>
	<p><code>master.inc.php</code> creates a new <code>Auth</code> object. This contains the currently authenticated user (or guest). As a security precaution, set <code>AUTH_SALT</code> to a random string of characters unique to your project. This is used by the <code>Auth</code> class to seed the hashing functions which helps to protect your users' passwords from <a href='http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000949.html'>rainbow attacks</a>.</p>
	<p>Note that the <code>Auth</code> class is designed to operate using plain text or hashed passwords. By default, to make testing easier, hashed passwords are turned off. However, once your site goes live, we <strong>strongly</strong> reccomend that you hash your passwords so they're not stored as plain text in the database. You can enable hashed passwords by setting <code>$useMD5</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>/includes/class.auth.php</code>.
	<p>You'll also want to import <a href='/_masters/install/mysql.sql'>this SQL file</a>. It installs the <code>user</code> table which <code>Auth</code> needs to operate.</p>

	<h2>All Done</h2>
	<p>See, that wasn't too bad, was it? Now that you've setup <code>master.inc.php</code> you might want to checkout our quick and dirty <a href='/_masters/install/install.php'>installer script</a>. It's not <em>really</em> an installer. It's just a quick way to create user accounts and generate your DBObject subclasses.</p>
